                <h2>Founder of Pakistan</h2>
                <p><b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah (1876â€“1948)</b> was a prominent political leader and statesman who played 
                    a pivotal role in the creation of Pakistan. As the leader of the All-India Muslim League, 
                    he advocated for the rights and interests of Muslims in British India. His unwavering efforts 
                    and negotiations led to the partition of India in 1947, resulting in the establishment of 
                    Pakistan as a separate nation for Muslims. Jinnah served as Pakistan's first Governor-General
                    until his passing in 1948, leaving behind a legacy as the "Quaid-e-Azam" (Great Leader) and 
                    a key figure in shaping the course of South Asian history.</p>
